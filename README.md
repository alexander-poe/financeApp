## Description
This app provides a simple way to keep track of personal finances using 3 budget techniques. The 20 / 30 / 50 system where 20% percent of your income goes to long term savings, 30% to whatever you want, and 50% for expenses. Envelopes where you seek to fill up a certain amount per term for example, rent or insurance. Lastly, a savings goal, where you declare what you want and it provides formulas for savings.
